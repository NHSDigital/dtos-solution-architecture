## Overview

Pathway Coordinator is the engine of the screening pathway. It allows core elements of screening pathways to be updated e.g. eligibilty criteria or screening intervals. Pathway Coordinator fulfills the pathway for each participant by managing data flow between products according to each specific pathway's definition. Pathway coordinator manages the screening outcome, including updating a participant's future pathway allocation and communicating to external sources e.g. GP and other healthcare professionals involved in treatment pathways.
