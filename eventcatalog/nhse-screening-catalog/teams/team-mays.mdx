## Why do we exist?

While the NHS provides digital records for most healthcare services through platforms like the NHS App, there is still no reliable way for people to view or manage their screening information digitally. This gap forces individuals to rely on paper letters as their only source of truth, creating confusion, missed appointments, and unnecessary anxiety. In a health system that is increasingly digital-first, screening remains an outlier that risks leaving people behind. 

We want to change that. 

## Our Vision

One Trusted Place for Screening Information 

We want to give people more than just visibility, we want to give them control. Our vision is to create a single, trusted space where people can not only see their screening information, like upcoming appointments, past results, and what’s coming next, but actively manage their entire screening journey. 

This means being able to book, reschedule, or cancel appointments, order and track test kits, receive timely reminders, and understand what their results mean and what to do next. Ultimately, we want to build a comprehensive screening portal that brings everything screening-related into one place, making it easier for people to stay informed, take action, and protect their health. 

Looking ahead, we see screening as a vital part of how people engage with their health early, often before they feel unwell. For many, screening is the first meaningful interaction they have with the NHS. That creates an important opportunity to frame screening not just as a check, but as the start of a preventative health journey, one that empowers people to stay healthier for longer, with the tools and confidence to make informed choices. 

To do that, we first need to untangle a complex system. Right now, there are over a dozen old technology platforms managing screening across the UK. These systems were cutting edge in their time, but they weren’t built to work together, and they can’t easily support modern, user-centred services.
